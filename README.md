In this repository I will add the exercises carried out in the cybersecurity bootcamp.
1) Calculator exercise: this aplication will ask the user for two numbers and the arithmetic operation they want to perfom. To avoid errors if a number or an incorrect operation is entered, I have used exception control. The program is written with Python. 
2) Pares or nones exercise: thos aplication imitates the game of pares or nones. It will as the user to choose one of two options and a number between 0 and 5. The machine will choose a number through the random library. Depending on the playerÂ´s choice and the result, the player or the machine will win.
